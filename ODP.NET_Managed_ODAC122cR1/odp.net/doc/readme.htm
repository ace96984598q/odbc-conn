        <h2><a name="new"></a>New Features</h2>
        <p>
            The following features are newly supported in this release, but were not included in the documentation.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                &nbsp;.NET Framework 4.7 certification
            </li>
        </ol>


    <a name="Managed Known Issues"></a><h2>ODP.NET, Managed Driver Tips, Limitations, and Known Issues</h2>
    This section contains information that is specific to ODP.NET, Managed Driver.

    <ol>
        <li>
            ODP.NET does not support usage of the "ALTER SESSION" statement to modify the Edition in Edition-Based Redefinition during the lifetime of a process.
        </li>
        <li>
            ODP.NET, Managed Driver and Distributed Transactions -
            Using managed ODP.NET distributed transactions with Oracle.ManagedDataAccessDTC.dll is deprecated as it is primarily used with .NET Framework 4 releases
            earlier than .NET 4.5.2. Microsoft has desupported these earlier .NET Framework 4 versions. Managed ODP.NET distributed transactions will continue to
            be supported and enhanced with .NET Framework's native fully managed distributed transaction implementation.
        </li>
	<li>OracleConnection object&#39;s OpenWithNewPassword() method invocation will result in 
            an ORA-1017 error with 11.2.0.3.0 and earlier versions of the database. [Bug 12876992]<br/>
    </li>
    </ol>

    <a name="Unmanaged Known Issues"></a><h2>ODP.NET, Unmanaged Driver Tips, Limitations, and Known Issues</h2>
    This section contains information that is specific to ODP.NET, Unmanaged Driver.

    <ol>
        <li>
            ODP.NET does not support usage of the "ALTER SESSION" statement to modify the Edition in Edition-Based Redefinition during the lifetime of a process.
        </li>
        <li>If SenderId is specified in OracleAQMessage object while enqueuing, the 
            sender id of dequeued message will have &quot;@ODP.NE&quot; appended in the end. [Bug 
            7315542]</li>

        <li>An &quot;ORA-00942: table or view does not exist&quot; error may be thrown from Dequeue or 
            DequeueArray method invocations when OracleAQDequeueOptions.DeliveryMode is 
            specified as OracleAQMessageDeliveryMode.Buffered and 
            OracleAQDequeueOptions.Correlation is specified and there are no messages 
            available in the queue. [Bug 7343633]
        </li>
        <li>Applications may not receive group notifications if GroupingInterval property on 
            the OracleNotificationRequest object is set to 0. [Bug 7373765]
        </li>
        <li>OracleConnection object&#39;s OpenWithNewPassword() method invocation will result in 
            an ORA-1017 error with pre-11.2.0.3.0 database versions. [Bug 12876992]
        </li>
    </ol>

    <a name="EF"><h2>Entity Framework Tips, Limitations, and Known Issues</h2>
    This section contains Entity Framework related information that pertains to both ODP.NET, Managed Driver and ODP.NET, Unmanaged Driver.
    <ol>
        <li>Interval Day to Second and Interval Year to Month column values cannot be 
            compared to literals in a WHERE clause of a LINQ to Entities or an Entity SQL 
            query.<br /><br /> </li>
        <li>LINQ to Entities and Entity SQL (ESQL) queries that require the usage of SQL 
            APPLY in the generated queries will cause SQL syntax error(s) if the Oracle 
            Database being used does not support APPLY. In such cases, the inner exception 
            message will indicate that APPLY is not supported by the database.<br /><br /> </li>
        <li>ODP.NET does not currently support wildcards that accept character ranges for 
            the LIKE operator in Entity SQL (i.e. [] and [^]). [Bug 11683837]<br /><br /> </li>
        <li>Executing LINQ or ESQL query against tables with one or more column names 
            that are close to or equal to the maximum length of identifiers (30 bytes) may 
            encounter &quot;ORA-00972: identifier is too long&quot; error, due to the usage of alias 
            identifier(s) in the generated SQL that exceed the limit.<br /><br /> </li>
        <li>An &quot;ORA-00932: inconsistent datatypes: expected - got NCLOB&quot; error will be 
            encountered when trying to bind a string that is equal to or greater than 2,000 
            characters in length to an XMLType column or parameter. [Bug 12630958]<br /><br /> </li>
        <li>An &quot;ORA-00932 : inconsistent datatypes&quot; error can be encountered if a string of 
            2,000 or more characters, or a byte array with 4,000 bytes or more in length, is 
            bound in a WHERE clause of a LINQ/ESQL query. The same error can be encountered 
            if an entity property that maps to a BLOB, CLOB, NCLOB, LONG, LONG RAW, XMLTYPE 
            column is used in a WHERE clause of a LINQ/ESQL query.<br /><br /> </li>
        <li>An &quot;Arithmetic operation resulted in an overflow&quot; exception can be 
            encountered when fetching numeric values that have more precision than what the 
            .NET type can support. In such cases, the LINQ or ESQL query can &quot;cast&quot; the 
            value to a particular .NET or EDM type to limit the precision and avoid the 
            exception. This approach can be useful if the LINQ/ESQL query has 
            computed/calculated columns which will store up to 38 precision in Oracle, which 
            cannot be represented as .NET decimal unless the value is casted. <br /><br /></li>
        <li>Oracle Database treats NULLs and empty strings the same. When executing string 
            related operations on NULLS or empty strings, the result will be NULL. When 
            comparing strings with NULLs, use the equals operator (i.e. &quot;x == NULL&quot;) in the 
            LINQ query, which will in turn use the &quot;IS NULL&quot; condition in the generated SQL 
            that will appropriately detect NULL-ness.<br /><br /></li>
        <li>If an exception message of &quot;The store provider factory type 
          &#39;Oracle.ManagedDataAccess.Client.OracleClientFactory&#39; does not implement the 
          IServiceProvider interface.&quot; is encountered when executing an Entity Framework 
          application with ODP.NET, the machine.config requires and entry for ODP.NET 
          under the &lt;DbProviderFactories&gt; section. To resolve this issue by adding an 
          entry in the machine.config, reinstall ODAC.<br /><br /></li>
        <li>Creating a second instance of the context that derives from DbContext within 
          an application and executing methods within the scope of that context that 
          result in an interaction with the database may result in unexpected recreation 
          of the database objects if the DropCreateDatabaseAlways database initializer is 
          used.<br /><br />More Information: 
          https://entityframework.codeplex.com/workitem/2362 <br /><br />Known Workarounds: <br />- Use a 
          different database initializer, <br />- Use an operating system authenticated user for 
          the connection, or <br />- Include &quot;Persist Security Info=true&quot; in the connection 
          string (Warning: Turning on &quot;Persist Security Info&quot; will cause the password to 
          remain as part of the connection string). <br /><br /></li>
          <li>Deinstallation of ODP.NET versions that are prior to ODAC 12c Release 3 
            production can cause entries with .NET 2.x assembly references to be entered in 
            the .NET 4.0 machine.config. This can cause side-by-side execution errors unless 
            config section entry for &quot;oracle.unmanageddataaccess.client&quot; that references 2.x 
            version of Oracle.DataAccess.Client is manually removed from the .NET 4.0 
            machine.config. It is also advised that a DbProviderFactories entry that 
            references 2.x version of Oracle.DataAccess.Client be removed manually as well. <br /><br /></li>
